Sort the deck in decreasing order: 
We start by sorting the deck in reverse order (from highest to lowest). This is because we want to place the highest card at the bottom of the deck first, and then proceed with the next highest card, and so on.  

Create a queue: 
We use a queue to simulate the process of revealing cards and moving the next card to the bottom. A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) rule, which is exactly what we need for this problem.  

Insert the card to the front of the queue: 
For each card in the sorted deck, we insert it to the front of the queue. This simulates the process of revealing the card.  

Move the card at the end of the queue to the front: 
After revealing a card, we need to move the next card to the bottom of the deck. In terms of the queue, this means moving the card at the end of the queue to the front.  

Repeat the process: 
We repeat steps 3 and 4 for each card in the sorted deck. This will result in a queue that represents the order of the deck that reveals the cards in increasing order
